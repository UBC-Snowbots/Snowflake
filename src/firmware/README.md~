### Udev Rules

Udev assigns the names specified in the rule file to the devices, which helps matching dev files with devices. More simply, udev rules allow us to guarantee that no matter what order we plug USB devices in, they will always be accessible at the same path in software.

- Rule Writing Guideline
	- Create file: `/etc/udev/rules.d/10-snowbots.rules` (where xx represent the priority; Here 10 is higher than 50, the default).
	    - Note: this is done in the bash file already
	- Write rules with match keys (helps identify devices) and assignment keys (assigns names/symlinks to identified devices)
	    - common match keys: 
	    	KERNEL - match against the kernel name for the device
	    	SUBSYSTEM - match against the subsystem of the device
	    	DRIVER - match against the name of the driver backing the device
	    - common assignment keys:
	    	NAME - the name that shall be used for the device node
	    	SYMLINK - a list of symbolic links which act as alternative names for the device node
	    	MODE - define Unix permissions, by default 0666 (read/write to owner group)
	    	GROUP - define the Unix group ownship of the device node
	- add your new rule to `10-snowbots.rules`
	- run `setup_udev_rules.sh` to apply your new rules

- Device Info Collection
	- Serial Number: `udevadm info -a -n /dev/ttyUSB1 | grep '{serial}' | head -n1`
	- Vendor ID and Product ID: `lsusb` (Bus xxx Device xxx: ID <Vendor>:<Product>)

- Example
```
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="<idVendor>", ATTRS{idProduct}=="<idProduct>", ATTRS{serial}=="<serial>", MODE="0666", SYMLINK+="SB-Ardu", GROUP="dialout"
```
